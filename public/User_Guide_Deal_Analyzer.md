## 📊 Key Metrics Explained

### Cash-on-Cash Return
**Formula**: (Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100

**What It Means**: For every dollar you invest, what percentage do you get back each year in cash?

**Good Benchmarks**:
- 20%+ = Excellent
- 15-20% = Very Good
- 10-15% = Good
- Below 10% = Marginal

### DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)
**Formula**: Net Operating Income / Annual Debt Service

**What It Means**: How many times over can the business cover its debt payments?

**Lender Requirements**:
- 1.25x+ = Typically required for approval
- 1.35x+ = Strong, favorable terms
- Below 1.0x = Insufficient cash flow

### ROI (Return on Investment)
**Formula**: (Total Returns / Total Investment) × 100

**Types Calculated**:
- Year 1 ROI (simple)
- Cumulative ROI (years 1-10)
- Annualized ROI (average per year)

### Equity Build-Up
**Components**:
1. Principal paydown on loans
2. Business appreciation
3. Total = Business Value - Remaining Debt

**Why It's Important**: This is wealth creation that happens "behind the scenes" beyond cash flow.

### Payback Period
**Formula**: Total Cash Invested / Annual Cash Flow

**What It Means**: How many years until you've recovered your initial investment through cash flow alone (excluding equity).

**Good Benchmarks**:
- 3-5 years = Excellent
- 5-7 years = Good
- 7-10 years = Acceptable
- 10+ years = High risk

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Always Run Scenarios**
Don't just look at base case. Check worst-case to understand risk.

### 2. **Focus on DSCR**
If DSCR < 1.25, deal may not get financed. Address this first.

### 3. **Consider Total Return**
Cash flow + equity build-up = total return. Many buyers miss this.

### 4. **Use Industry Benchmarks**
Compare your deal to industry standards for validation.

### 5. **Save Everything**
Create a library of analyzed deals for comparison and learning.

### 6. **Generate PDFs Early**
Have professional reports ready for unexpected opportunities.

### 7. **Stress Test Conservatively**
Use realistic (or even pessimistic) growth assumptions.

### 8. **Don't Forget CAPEX**
Many buyers overlook maintenance capital expenditures.

### 9. **Account for Working Capital**
This is real cash you need - don't skip it.

### 10. **Review All Tabs**
Each tab provides unique insights - don't just look at ROI.
