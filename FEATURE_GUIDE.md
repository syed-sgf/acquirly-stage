### 4. Industry Benchmarks

**Built-in Standards:**

## 🎓 Educational Features

### Learn While You Analyze

Every field teaches you:
1. **What it means** - Plain English definition

4. **How lenders view it** - Underwriting perspective

## 🔍 How Each Metric is Calculated

### Cash-on-Cash Return
```
Formula: Net Cash Flow / Buyer Equity
Example: $215,000 / $300,000 = 71.7% (annual)
        Or 28.5% after normalizing
        
What it means: Your cash yield on equity invested
Good range: 20-35%
```

### Return on Investment (ROI)
```
Formula: Net Cash Flow / (Equity + Closing Costs)
Example: $215,000 / $360,000 = 59.7%

What it means: Return on ALL cash you put in
Considers: Both equity and transaction costs
```

### Leverage Ratio
```
Formula: Total Debt / Equity
Example: ($1.3M + $0.2M + $0.2M) / $300K = 5.67x

What it means: How much you're borrowing vs. your cash
Risk indicator:
  - Low (< 3x): Conservative
  - Moderate (3-5x): Typical
  - High (> 5x): Aggressive
```

### DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)
```
Formula: Lendable Cash Flow / Annual Debt Service
Example: $400,000 / $185,000 = 2.16x

SBA Requirements:
  - Minimum: 1.25x
  - Preferred: 1.35x+
  - Excellent: 1.50x+
```

### Using the Field Guide
1. **First Time**: Click "Field Guide" and read through all definitions
2. **During Analysis**: Keep it open in a second window
