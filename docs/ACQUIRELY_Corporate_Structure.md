# ACQUIRELY — Corporate Structure & Entity Strategy
**Confidential | Starting Gate Financial & Packet Rain**
> *Two companies. One ecosystem. Maximum protection.*

---

## Overview

| Entity | Role | NAICS | Domain |
|--------|------|-------|--------|
| **Packet Rain LLC** | Platform Operator & Tech Company | 541519 | packetrain.com |
| **Starting Gate Financial** | Lending Company & Enterprise Client | 522320 | startinggatefinancial.com |

---

## 01 — Why Two Entities

Starting Gate Financial operates under **NAICS 522320 — Financial Transactions Processing**, which flags as high-risk with Stripe, Finix, and most payment processors regardless of what the platform actually does.

**Packet Rain LLC** under **NAICS 541519 — Other Computer Related Services** is:
- ✅ Fully unrestricted by all major payment processors
- ✅ Standard approval for Stripe, Finix, Braintree, PayPal
- ✅ Qualifies as SBA small business (under $34M receipts)
- ✅ Clean profile for future fundraising or acquisition

## 04 — Domain Strategy

| Domain | Status | Owner | Purpose |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| `packetrain.com` | ✅ Owned | Packet Rain | Corporate tech brand |
| `acqyrly.com` | 🔴 Register Now | Packet Rain | ACQUIRELY working domain (~$12/yr) |
| `acquirely.com` | ⚠️ Taken | Unknown | Backorder immediately at GoDaddy Auctions |
| `startinggatefinancial.com` | ✅ Owned | SGF | Lending brand |

---

## 05 — Payment Processor Strategy

### Stripe
- **Account:** Packet Rain LLC
- **Category:** SaaS / Software
- **NAICS:** 541519
- **Description:** "B2B SaaS platform for business acquisition analysis"
- **Action:** Verify current account is under Packet Rain — if under SGF, create new account and migrate

### Finix (Embedded Payments)
- **Account:** Packet Rain LLC
- **Category:** B2B SaaS Marketplace
- **NAICS:** 541519
- **Description:** "B2B SaaS marketplace for business acquisition and M&A professionals. Platform facilitates commission payments, advisory fees, and marketplace service payments between brokers, buyers, and service providers."
- **Action:** Apply at finix.com/contact — 5–10 business day approval

> ⚠️ **Critical:** Never reference "loan servicing," "lending," or NAICS 522320 in any payment processor application. Packet Rain is a technology company. SGF's lending activities are entirely separate.

## 06 — Future NAICS Consideration

| NAICS | Description | When to Consider |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **541519** | Other Computer Related Services | ✅ Current — use now |
| **513210** | Software Publishers | When raising Series A or SBA tech grants |
| **518210** | Data Processing & Web Hosting | If expanding into data/analytics products |

---

## 07 — Inter-Company Agreement

Packet Rain and SGF need a formal **Platform License Agreement** documenting:
- Monthly licensing fee paid by SGF to Packet Rain (deductible for SGF)
- SGF's rights to branding and leads on the platform
- Lead referral process and tracking
- Data ownership and confidentiality
- Revenue sharing terms if applicable

> Consult a Texas business attorney. Standard agreement: 3–8 pages, $500–$2,000 to draft.

## 09 — Strategic Vision

| Today | Year 2 | Year 3+ |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Packet Rain builds ACQUIRELY under 541519 | Packet Rain = profitable SaaS company, $3M+ ARR | Raise seed/Series A or strategic acquisition |
| SGF = enterprise client, gets free platform use | SGF = top referral source, $4M+ loan volume | SGF = regional lender, $50M+ loan portfolio |
| `acqyrly.com` live as working domain | `acquirely.com` acquired | `acquirely.com` = dominant brand |

**The moat:** Tech platform + lending partner + deal flow + transaction data. Neither can be easily replicated because the flywheel requires both companies working together — and you own both.
